             Hi, I'm Manish Bhunia, a tech enthusiast and thinker, constantly exploring the vast world of technology. With a background in web development, cybersecurity, and backend technologies, I am passionate about future-proof tech fields and always eager to learn and adapt.
I'm currently in my second year of college, pursuing a tech-focused education while independently diving into modern fields like cybersecurity and cloud computing. Over the years, I have explored various domains, including web development (Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap), app development, AI, and cybersecurity. My journey has helped me understand the evolving tech landscape and refine my focus toward a future-proof career path.

I believe in continuous learning and challenging the status quo. While my college curriculum is outdated, I take the initiative to stay ahead by acquiring skills relevant to the industry. My interest lies in backend development, cybersecurity, and exploring how AI is shaping the future.
